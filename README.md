AddaNN
=======

This is a course project for an Artificial Intelligence class at Tecnológico de Costa Rica. The goal of the project is to create an artificial neural network using the Rumelhart & McClelland approach and a genetic algorithm to learn in a supervised way. The knowledge that the net will be going to learn is the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers, resulting in a 5-bit binary number. The name of the project, AddaNN, means Addition artificial Neural Network.

The project team consists of two Computer Engineering students:

    Ana Irina Calvo Carvajal, email: acalvo@ic-itcr.ac.cr
    Juan José Rojas Valverde, email: juanrojas@ic-itcr.ac.cr
